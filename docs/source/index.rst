Skein is a simple library and cli for deploying applications on `Apache YARN
<https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html>`_.
While YARN has many features that make it powerful for developing resilient
applications, these features also can make it difficult for developers to use.

Skein aims to be easy to use, providing just as much YARN as your project
needs.
